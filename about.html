I am Moez Ben-Azzouz, I have a background in both computer science and mathematics and teach courses covering both areas. My interests include computer programming, cryptography, cybersecurity, ML/AI, and mathematics. I love to learn new things everyday and strive to inspire my students to take ownership of their learning journey and pursue learning-oriented goals rather than simple, limiting outcomes-oriented goals.
